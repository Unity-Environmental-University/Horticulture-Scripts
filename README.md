# Horticulture Scripts

> Script-only slice of the Horticulture project — a Unity 6 experience that teaches Integrated Pest Management through hands-on plant care challenges.

## Snapshot

| Detail | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Unity | 6 (6000.x series) |
| Platforms | Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS |
| Repository Scope | Code-only mirror of the gameplay logic; assets and content ship from the main game repo |
| Status | Active development — expect experimental branches and in-flight systems |

## Highlights

- 🌱 Scenario-driven lessons that reinforce sustainable growing practices.
- 🪲 Dynamic pest identification and treatment workflows built on reusable card systems.
- 🧠 Modular architecture: MonoBehaviours orchestrate plain-C# subsystems for easier testing and iteration.
