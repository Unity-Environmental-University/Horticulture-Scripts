Dehydrated

When substrate moisture drops too low, foliage wilts, leaf margins crisp, and overall vigor collapses. Each dry day compounds stress as cells lose turgor, photosynthesis stalls, and the plantâ€™s resale value falls. Restore consistent irrigation and moderate humidity quickly; prolonged dehydration leads to irreversible wilt and death.
