- **Treatment Selection**: Understand which treatments work for specific problems
- **Economic Decision Making**: Balance costs and benefits of treatments
- **Sustainable Practices**: Prefer biological and cultural controls over chemical treatments
- **Prevention Strategies**: Learn how to prevent pest problems before they occur

## Game Mechanics

### Basic Gameplay Loop

Each round follows this structure:

1. **Plant Placement**: Plants are automatically placed on the board
2. **Affliction Phase**: Random pests/diseases appear on plants
3. **Player Turns**: You have 4 turns to treat afflicted plants
4. **Treatment Application**: Applied treatments take effect
5. **Scoring**: Calculate profit based on plant health vs. treatment costs
6. **Shop Phase**: Purchase new treatment cards for future rounds

### Turn Structure

**Each Turn:**
1. **Draw Cards**: Receive 4 treatment cards (default)
2. **Assess Situation**: Examine plants and their afflictions
3. **Select Treatment**: Choose a card from your hand
4. **Place Treatment**: Click on the plant location to apply treatment
5. **End Turn**: Click "End Turn" to proceed

**Between Turns:**
- Treatments take effect
- Afflictions may spread to adjacent plants
- Plant values may change based on health

- Small, green or black insects clustered on plant parts
- Sticky honeydew residue
- Curled or distorted leaves

**Behavior:**
- Reproduce rapidly
- Spread to adjacent plants (50% chance per turn)
- Prefer new growth and flowering plants

**Impact:** -$2 value reduction per infected plant

#### Mealy Bugs  
**Visual Signs:**
- White, cotton-like masses on plants

- Stunted growth

**Behavior:**
- More difficult to control than aphids
- Spread slowly to adjacent plants
- Hide in plant crevices

**Impact:** -$4 value reduction per infected plant

#### Thrips
**Visual Signs:**
- Silvery streaks on leaves
- Small, dark insects (visible with magnification)
- Black specks of excrement

**Behavior:**
- Most damaging pest in the game
- Can spread to ANY plant on the board (not just adjacent)
- Multiply rapidly with egg-laying

**Impact:** -$5 value reduction per infected plant

#### Mildew
**Visual Signs:**
- White, powdery coating on leaves
- Gradual spread across plant surface
- Affected areas become brown/yellow

**Behavior:**
- Fungal disease, not an insect
- Spreads in humid conditions
- Requires specific fungal treatments

**Impact:** -$4 value reduction per infected plant

### Treatment Selection Guide

#### For Soft-Bodied Insects (Aphids, Mealy Bugs)
**Best Options:**
1. **Horticultural Oil** (-$1) - Cost-effective, environmentally friendly
2. **Soapy Water** (-$1) - Cheapest option, good for light infestations
3. **Permethrin** (-$3) - Fast-acting for severe infestations

#### For Thrips (Most Dangerous)
**Best Options:**
1. **Spinosad** (-$4) - Biological, specifically effective against thrips
2. **Imidacloprid** (-$2) - Systemic action, prevents re-infestation
3. **Panacea** (-$5) - Guaranteed cure but expensive

#### For Fungal Issues (Mildew)
**Best Options:**
1. **Fungicide** (-$2) - Specific treatment for fungal problems
2. **Panacea** (-$5) - Universal cure, use for valuable plants

#### Universal Treatment
**Panacea** (-$5):
- Cures ALL afflictions on a plant
- Prevents spreading to/from treated plants
- Most expensive option
- Best for high-value plants with multiple problems

## Treatment Strategies

### Economic Considerations

#### Cost-Benefit Analysis
Before treating a plant, consider:
- **Plant Value**: High-value plants (Chrysanthemum) justify expensive treatments
- **Treatment Cost**: Don't spend more on treatment than the plant is worth
- **Spread Risk**: Treat spreading afflictions quickly to prevent further losses
- **Turn Remaining**: Early treatment is more effective than late treatment

#### Strategic Decision Making

**When to Treat:**
- High-value plants with any affliction
- Any plant with Thrips (spreads globally)
- Plants with multiple afflictions
- When treatment cost < potential losses from spreading

**When to Sacrifice:**
- Low-value plants with expensive-to-treat problems
- Plants near death (multiple severe afflictions)
- When treatment cost > plant value + spread prevention value

### Prevention Strategies

#### Board Management
- **Plant Placement**: Consider adjacency for spread-prone afflictions
- **Early Intervention**: Treat problems before they spread
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify which plants are most vulnerable

#### Resource Management
- **Hand Management**: Save expensive treatments for serious problems
- **Redraw Strategy**: Consider redrawing poor hands (costs $3)
- **Card Retention**: Keep one useful card between rounds

#### Redraw Restrictions

The redraw mechanic has specific timing restrictions to prevent exploitation:

**When You CAN Redraw:**
- At the start of any turn (before placing cards)
- After ending your turn (cards from previous turns remain on the table)
- When you have cards from earlier turns on plants but haven't placed anything this turn

**When You CANNOT Redraw:**
- After placing cards during the current turn
- While card animations are in progress
- If any cards were placed this turn (even if picked up again)

**Strategic Implications:**
- Plan your card placements carefully—once you place a card this turn, you lose redraw access
- Swapping cards preserves the original placement turn (you can't exploit swaps to enable redraw)
- Cards from previous turns don't block redraw, allowing you to build on existing strategies

**Example Scenarios:**
- ✅ Turn 1: Place 2 cards → End Turn → Turn 2: Redraw available (cards are from Turn 1)
- ❌ Turn 2: Place 1 card → Try to redraw (BLOCKED - card placed this turn)
- ✅ Turn 2: Start turn → Redraw immediately (no cards placed yet this turn)

### Advanced Techniques

#### Affliction Spread Prediction
- **Adjacent Spread**: Most afflictions spread to neighboring plants (50% chance)
- **Thrips Exception**: Thrips can spread to ANY plant without the affliction
- **Immunity**: Plants that have had an affliction gain some resistance

#### Treatment Timing
- **Early Turns**: Focus on preventing spread
- **Middle Turns**: Address multiple problems efficiently
- **Late Turns**: Triage most valuable plants

#### Economic Optimization
- **Profit Maximization**: Plant value + affliction penalties + treatment costs
- **Break-Even Analysis**: When is treatment worth the cost?
- **Investment Strategy**: Sometimes losing a plant saves money overall

## Scoring System

### Score Calculation

Your final score each round equals:
```
Final Score = Plant Values + Affliction Penalties + Treatment Costs + Current Money
```

**Components:**
- **Plant Values**: Positive values from healthy plants
- **Affliction Penalties**: Negative values from untreated problems
- **Treatment Costs**: Negative values from cards used
- **Current Money**: Your remaining cash

### Money Goals

Each level has a money goal you must reach to advance:
- **Level 1**: $100 target
- **Level 2**: $150 target  
- **Level 3**: $200 target
- **Higher levels**: Increasing targets

### Score Optimization Tips

1. **Maximize Plant Health**: Healthy plants generate positive income
2. **Minimize Treatment Costs**: Use the cheapest effective treatments
3. **Prevent Spread**: One untreated affliction can cost more than prevention
4. **Strategic Sacrifice**: Sometimes losing one plant saves multiple others
5. **Long-term Thinking**: Investment in prevention pays off over multiple rounds

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "My treatments aren't working!"
**Possible Causes:**
- Wrong treatment type (fungicide for insects, insecticide for fungi)
- Treatment applied too late in plant's decline
- Multiple afflictions requiring different treatments

**Solutions:**
- Check treatment descriptions for effectiveness
- Apply treatments early for best results
- Use Panacea for multiple afflictions

#### "I keep running out of money!"
**Possible Causes:**
- Over-treating low-value plants
- Using expensive treatments unnecessarily
- Not preventing affliction spread

**Solutions:**
- Focus on cost-effective treatments
- Sacrifice unsalvageable plants
- Prioritize spread prevention
- Consider redrawing expensive card hands

#### "Afflictions keep spreading everywhere!"
**Possible Causes:**
- Not treating spreading afflictions quickly
- Thrips (which spread globally) left untreated
- Focus on high-value plants while ignoring spreaders

**Solutions:**
- Treat Thrips immediately regardless of plant value
- Address adjacent spread patterns early
- Sometimes treat low-value plants to prevent spreading

#### "I can't beat the tutorial!"
**Solutions:**
- Read treatment card descriptions carefully
- Focus on the highest-value plants first
- Don't be afraid to sacrifice plants that cost more to treat than they're worth
- Use Panacea sparingly but effectively
